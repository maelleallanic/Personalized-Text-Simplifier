The program will simplify complex text into a personalized simpler version 
based on the user’s preferences. 
The project is designed for people with learning differences so that they
can get a personalized text because they might struggle with some words more than other words. 
Preferences could be like, no words with “b and d”, no uncommon words, 
words that look similar to other common words, no words with multiple very different meanings. 
The simplified version will also provide other synonyms/a definition/example when the user hovers over the word.

The user should run the termproject.py file

You need to install nltk, here is a good instructional video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDflkMr3Wl4
